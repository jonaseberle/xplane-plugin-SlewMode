# X-Plane FlyWithLua plugin "SlewMode"

## What it does

It allows to use a joystick to move and rotate the aircraft. It follows the terrain (when on the ground).

## Requirements

* FlyWithLua [NG for X-Plane 11](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/38445-flywithlua-ng-next-generation-edition-for-x-plane-11-win-lin-mac/) or [NG+ for X-Plane 12](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/82888-flywithlua-ng-next-generation-plus-edition-for-x-plane-12-win-lin-mac/)
* Tested with X-Plane 11 and 12

## Installation

Put the .lua file into `./Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts/`

## Usage

### Quickstart

* Bind the command `flightwusel/SlewMode/Toggle` to a key or joystick button.
* Press the key/button to enable/disable Slew Mode. While active, it will announce the current mode on-screen ("free" or "following terrain").
  In terrain-following mode it will keep the plane sticked to the ground. You change the mode to "free" by increasing altitude. When you "hit" the ground, terrain following mode is engaged.
* Use your joystick to move the aircraft:
  - Pitch axis -> move forward/backward
  - Roll axis -> move sideways
  - Yaw axis -> heading
* Use your joystick to roll the aircraft:
  - While pressing <kbd>SPACE</kbd> (the "modifier key") you can roll the aircraft with the joystick:
    - Pitch axis -> pitch
    - Roll axis -> roll
* Change altitude:
  - You can bind keys for increasing/decreasing altitude.
* Keep moving in a direction:
  - While pressing <kbd>SHIFT+SPACE</kbd> (SHIFT+"modifier key") your current joystick input will be the default movement vector.
    Example: Move stick forward, press <kbd>SHIFT+SPACE</kbd> and you will continue to move forward even
    if you center the stick again.
    (Press <kbd>SHIFT+SPACE</kbd> with the joystick centered to stop again)
